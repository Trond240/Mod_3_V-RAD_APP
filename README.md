# Rad Rentals!- Its like AirBnB.... kind of....  

This project was the first group project for Module 3 at Turing School of Software And Design. 

The goal of this project was to get familiar with several new technologies used in React Framework. The main focus was on fetching data from a server and displaying the data on the DOM. Every component had to be tested using Jest and React Testing Library. 


## Installing / Getting started

Clone down the repo. Use terminal commands to navigate to the root folder of the repo locally.

1. npm install
2. cd into src folder
3. npm start
4. navigate to local port:3000 in your browser

## Steps to use the App

The app is very simple to use. After you log in (there is no authentication, you can put whatever you want) you can navigate to different areas and listings. You can also add listings to your favorites.

### Technologies Used

* React
* JSX
* Jest and React Testing Library
* Fetch API
* React Router

## Learning Goals


### Practice and demonstrate understanding of the following:

* Using Basic React Class and Functional Components
* Implement Unit and Integration testing with React Testing Library
* Become familiar with React Router




## Challenges

The most challenging part of this project was testing. React testing is very different from testing vanilla javascript functions/methods and required a lot more planning. 

## Wins

We were able to accomplish all of the functionality and most of the testing. The biggest win was getting asynchronous testing working and understanding how each step is accomplished.
